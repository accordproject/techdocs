## Add a Template to a Library

The Cicero template library is stored in a GitHub repository: https://github.com/accordproject/cicero-template-library

To contribute new templates please fork the repository and then create a pull request. Note that templates
should have unit tests. See the ``acceptance-of-delivery`` template for an example with unit tests.
