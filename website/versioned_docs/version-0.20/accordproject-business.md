## Why is the Accord Project relevant for business?

Contracting is undergoing a digital transformation driven by a need to deliver customer-centric legal and business solutions faster, and at lower cost. This imperative is fueling the adoption of a broad range of new technologies to improve the efficiency of drafting, managing, and executing legal contracting operations; the Accord Project is proud to be part of that movement.

In addition, contributions from businesses are crucial for the development of the Accord Project. The expertise of stakeholders, such as business professionals and attorneys, is invaluable in improving the functionality and content of the Accord Project's codebase and specifications, to ensure that the templates meet real-world business requirements.

## Why is the Accord Project relevant for lawyers?

Even the best code would be useless if it does not meet industry needs and requirements, so input from the legal community to steer the direction of smart legal contract technology is crucial. By creating templates for contract clauses or reviewing templates, lawyers can influence the direction of the Accord Project. In addition, feedback using domain-specific expertise can enhance the value and usability of the Accord Project templates to users.

As an individual, contributing to the Accord Project would be a great opportunity to learn about smart legal contracts. Through the Accord Project, you can understand the foundations of open source technologies and learn how to develop smart agreements.

If you are new to the Accord Project, the best place to start is our [Online Tour](started-studio). This video is a great way to see the Accord Project in action! If you want to read more about the key concepts behind the Accord Project technology (or learn more about the template model), please read the [Key Concepts](accordproject-concepts) page. This will allow you to understand the three components of a template (text, model, and logic) and how they work together.

If any of the technical terms are confusing or hard to understand, we have a [Glossary](ref-glossary) page that may help you. If there are any concepts or terms that you want to include in the Glossary, please join our [slack channel](https://accord-project-slack-signup.herokuapp.com/) and make suggestions!

If you want to create a template yourself, please see [Authoring in Template Studio](tutorial-latedelivery) for a step-by-step guide on how to create your first template. The tutorial will provide an accessible starting point for those without significant development experience to begin building smart legal contracts using the Accord Project technology.
