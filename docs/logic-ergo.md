Ergo provides a simple expression language to describe computation. From those expressions one can write functions, clauses, and then whole contract logic. This page explains most of the Ergo concepts starting from simple expressions all the way to contracts.

Ergo is a _strongly typed_ language, which means it checks that the expressions you use are consistent (e.g., you can take the square root of `3.14` but not of `"pi!"`). The type system is here to help you write better and safer contract logic, but it also takes a little getting used to. This page also introduces Ergo types and how to work with them.
