# Introduction

Concerto is a lightweight data modeling (schema) language and runtime for business concepts.

Here is a simple model, expressed using the Concerto CTO syntax:

```cs
namespace test@1.0.0

enum Country {
   o UK
   o USA
   o FRANCE
   o GERMANY
   o JAPAN
}

concept Address {
   o String street
   o String city
   o String postCode
   o Country country
}

concept Person identified by name  {
  o String name
  o Address address optional
  @description("Height (cm)")
  o Double height range=[0.0,]
  o DateTime dateOfBirth
}
```

And here is the **generated** Plant UML diagram for the model:

üè¢ Concerto gives you ‚Äújust enough‚Äù expressivity to capture real-world business models, while remaining easy to map to most runtime environments.

‚õ≥ An object-oriented language that is much easier to read and write than JSON/XML Schema, XMI or equivalents.

üìÑ Serialize your instances to JSON

üç™ Deserialize (and validate) instances from JSON

üîé Runtime introspection of the model using a powerful set of APIs

üéõ Convert the model to [14+ common data model formats](./category/code-generation)

üï∏ Publish your reusable models to any website, including the Accord Project [model repository](https://models.accordproject.org)

Infer models from other formats:

- JSON document
- JSON Schema
- OpenAPI v3 specification
