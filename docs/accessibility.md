# Accessibility and Inclusive Design

The Accord Project aims to ensure that its tools, documentation, and interfaces are accessible to as many people as possible. Accessibility is a core part of inclusive design, which considers the full range of human diversity, including abilities, disabilities, language, and technology access.

## What is Accessibility?

Accessibility refers to the practice of designing digital products so they can be used by people with a wide range of abilities. This includes users who rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers, keyboard navigation, or alternative input devices.

## WCAG 2.1 Overview

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 provide internationally recognized standards for web accessibility. WCAG is organized around four key principles:

- **Perceivable**: Information must be presented in ways users can perceive.
- **Operable**: User interface components must be usable via different input methods.
- **Understandable**: Content and interfaces should be clear and predictable.
- **Robust**: Content should work reliably with current and future assistive technologies.

Accord Project documentation and web-based tools aim to align with these principles where applicable.

## Why WCAG Matters to the Accord Project

Following WCAG guidelines helps ensure that:
- Documentation is usable by contributors with different accessibility needs
- Tools can be accessed using assistive technologies
- New features consider accessibility early in the design process

Accessibility considerations are especially important for open source projects, as they support diverse global communities.
