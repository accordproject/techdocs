# ADR: Integration of a Custom Chatbot

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our project requires a conversational AI assistant to enhance user interactions and provide helpful responses.

## Decision

We have decided to integrate Concerto models through chatbots into our project. AI bots like ChatGPT,OpenAI, Bard, Anthropic etc are powerful language models that can generate human-like text based on the input it receives. This integration will allow us to provide more engaging and intelligent interactions for our users.

## Consequences

- **Pros:**
  - Enhanced user experience with intelligent responses.
  - Ability to handle a wide range of user queries and inputs.
  - Potential for improved user engagement and satisfaction.
- **Cons:**
  - Requires integration effort and API usage.
  - May require additional processing for complex interactions.
  - Privacy and security considerations for handling user data.
  - Requires extensive custom requests and responses/intents to be added to the bot
   

## Implementation Details

- **Location:** Create a new module or service file (e.g., `chatGPTService.js`) to handle interactions with the bot API. In this case: Dialogflow
- **API Key:** Store the API key securely and avoid hardcoding it in the source code.
- **Integration:** Use the OpenAI SDK or direct API calls to interact with Dialogflow.
- **Testing:** Implement tests to ensure the integration works as expected and handles various scenarios.
