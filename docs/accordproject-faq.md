# Accord Project — Frequently Asked Questions

---

## 🧠 What is a “Smart Contract” in the Accord Project?

A **smart legal contract** is a legally binding agreement written in digital form that can connect its terms and obligations to external data or systems.  

These contracts allow:
- **Automation** of legal or business processes (e.g., triggering a payment when a shipment is delivered).
- **Real-time visibility** and validation for all parties involved.
- **Integration** with both traditional software and emerging technologies like blockchain.

> ⚙️ **Note:** Blockchain is **optional**.  
> Accord Project contracts are **blockchain-agnostic** — they can run on blockchains *or* on standard software systems.

A smart legal contract combines:
- **Natural language text** — the readable part of the agreement.  
- **Machine-executable logic** — defined using the Accord Project libraries.

This enables documents to be:
- Structured as **machine-readable data objects**  
- Executed or integrated with external systems (e.g., payments, invoicing, updates)

Although the primary focus is smart legal contracts, Accord Project technology can be adapted for any type of **machine-readable or executable documentation**.

## 🔗 How is an Accord Project “Smart Contract” different from blockchain “Smart Contracts”?

Accord Project **Smart Legal Contracts** are not the same as blockchain “smart contracts.”  

| Aspect | Blockchain Smart Contracts | Accord Project Smart Legal Contracts |
|--------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Environment** | Operate *within* a blockchain only | Work on or *off* a blockchain |
| **Language** | Usually written in Solidity (e.g., Ethereum) | Use **Ergo** and natural language templates |
| **Integration** | Closed system, limited communication | Open — can send, receive, and process data |
| **Structure** | Code-centric | Combines text templates, data models, and executable logic |

In short, Accord Project contracts **bridge the legal and technical worlds**, allowing contracts to interact dynamically with external systems — including blockchains if desired.

## ⚙️ What benefits do Smart Legal Contracts provide?

Traditional contracts are static documents — often Word or PDF files — that humans must interpret.  
Smart legal contracts, on the other hand, can be:
- **Searched** and **queried** like structured data.  
- **Analyzed** and **monitored** in real time.  
- **Integrated** directly with business systems (ERP, CRM, payment APIs, etc.).  

### ✅ Key Benefits
- **Accuracy** — data models ensure all necessary fields are complete and valid.  
- **Automation** — contracts can self-update or trigger actions automatically.  
- **Insight** — real-time data turns contracts into live business assets instead of static records.  

A Smart Legal Contract becomes a **living process** — it contains the text, the data model, and the logic that can react to the outside world.

## 🌐 What is the Accord Project and what is its purpose?

The **Accord Project** is a non-profit, member-driven organization creating **open source tools and standards** for smart legal contracts.  

Its goal is to provide a **common legal and technical foundation** that helps businesses, lawyers, and developers build interoperable smart contracts.

### Key aspects:
- Open source and free to use.  
- Governed by multiple **working groups** focused on specific use cases (e.g., finance, legal, operations).  
- Supported by a **Technology Working Group** that develops core specifications and reference implementations.

## 🤝 How can I get involved?

The Accord Project community is open to everyone — developers, lawyers, and organizations.

### Ways to Participate
- **Join Working Groups** – Focused on specific smart contract applications.  
- **Participate in Discussions** – Join the [Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/Zm99SKhhtA) for regular updates and collaboration.  
- **Contribute Templates and Models** – Build and share your own smart legal contract templates using the [Template Studio](https://studio.accordproject.org/).  

The community’s goal is to build a **universal, open library** of modular smart contracts based on the [Cicero Specification](https://github.com/accordproject/cicero).

### About Ergo
The Accord Project has developed **Ergo**, a programming language designed for smart legal contracts.  
Ergo is:
- **Readable** by both lawyers and developers.  
- **Portable** across SaaS platforms and blockchains.  
- **Secure** and **safe** for legally enforceable automation.  

You can try Ergo directly in the [Template Studio](https://studio.accordproject.org/).

## 🏁 Summary

- Smart legal contracts combine human-readable language and machine-executable logic.  
- They can run *with or without* blockchain, offering flexibility and automation.  
- The Accord Project provides the **standards, libraries, and community** to make this possible.
