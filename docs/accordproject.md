## What is Accord Project?

Accord Project is an open source, non-profit, initiative working to transform contract management and contract automation by digitizing contracts. 

The Accord Project provides an open, industry-driven, specification and implementation for _smart legal contracts_. Participants include some of the leading law firms and blockchain technology organizations in the world.

For more information about the Accord Project as a whole (how to join, upcoming meetings, latest news, open source process, etc) please visit the main [Accord Project Web Site](https:www.accordproject.org).

## Technology

The Accord Project provides a complete solution for smart legal contract development.

The Open Source [Cicero project](https://github.com/accordproject/cicero) defines the format of clause and contract templates based on to the [Accord Project Template Specification.](accordproject-specification)

![Template Grammar](/docs/assets/grammar.png)

All of the Accord Project technology is being developed and maintained as open source:
- [Cicero](cicero.md): reusable executable templates for legal contracts and clauses
- [Ergo](ergo.md): domain specific language to express the executable logic of legal templates
- [Template Studio](accordproject-studio.md) : a Web-based editor for legal templates

In addition, 
- [Model Repository](accordproject-models.md) : a repository of open source data models for use in Cicero templates and with Ergo logic
- [Template Library](accordproject-templates.md) : a library of open source Cicero templates

All these software packages are under active development and we encourage companies and individuals to contribute requirements, documentation, issues and code.
