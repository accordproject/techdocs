## What is Accord Project?

Accord Project is an open source, non-profit, initiative aimed at transforming contract management and contract automation by digitizing contracts.

Accord Project defines a notion of legal template with associated computing logic which is expressive, open-source, and portable. 

Accord project templates are similar to a clause or contract template in any document format, but they can be read, interpreted, and run by a computer.
