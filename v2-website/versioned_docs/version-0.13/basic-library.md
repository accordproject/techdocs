This tutorial explains how to contribute a new template to the Accord Project Template Library.

## Prerequisites

Accord Project uses [GitHub](https://github.com/) to maintain its open source template library. For this tutorial, you must first obtain and configure the following dependency:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com): We use Node to generate the
  documentation, run a development web server, run tests, and generate
  distributable files. Depending on your system, you can install Node
  either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

You will also need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. If this is your first time working with GitHub, you can find a number of guides [here](https://guides.github.com).

## Clone the template library

If you have `git` installed you can `git clone` the template library to download all the templates, or you can use the "Download" button inside GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/accordproject/cicero-template-library
```
    
## Add a Template to a Library

The Cicero template library is stored in a GitHub repository: https://github.com/accordproject/cicero-template-library

To contribute new templates please fork the repository and then create a pull request. Note that templates
should have unit tests. See the ``acceptance-of-delivery`` template for an example with unit tests.
